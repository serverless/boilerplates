# Legacy templates

The templates in this directory are used by `serverless create` command with `--template` flag (that will be replaced with `serverless`) and previously lived directly in `serverless/serverless` repository.

We still accept adjustments to existing templates, but we will not accept new templates supported by the `serverless create --template <template-name>` command directly.
