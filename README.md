## Getting Started

If you are new to serverless, we recommend getting started with by creating an HTTP API Endpoint in [NodeJS](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-simple-http-endpoint), [Python](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-python-simple-http-endpoint), [Java](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-java-simple-http-endpoint), or [Golang](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-golang-simple-http-endpoint).

## Examples

Each example contains a `README.md` with an explanation about the service and it's use cases.

**Have an example?** Submit a PR or [open an issue](https://github.com/serverless/examples/issues). ⚡️

To install any of these you can run:

```bash
serverless install -u https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/folder-name -n my-project
```
